## ✨ **Main Highlights**

- **Database Design:** Tables created with `CREATE TABLE` statements, including `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** SQL queries demonstrating the use of `JOIN`, `CASE WHEN`, filtering, aggregation and more.
- **Visualizations:** Dashboards and charts in **Power BI** to visualize trends and statistics.
